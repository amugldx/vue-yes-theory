# Yes Theory

Yes theory is a youtube channel that i love to watch. They have very inspiring story and i get motivated by watching their videos. One day i visited their official website and it was poorly made and i didn't like their ui/ux so i opened up figma and disigned their website from scratch. After that i developed it using vue3 and tailwindcss.

## Website

[yes theory site](yestheory.netlify.app)

## Project setup

```
npm install
```
